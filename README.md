# Role Playing Game

This is a simple role playing game (RPG) that I made as part of the [freecodecamp course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/) on JavaScript. The game uses basic concepts of JavaScript such as variables, functions, loops, arrays, and objects.
